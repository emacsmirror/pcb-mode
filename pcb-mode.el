;;; Commentary:

;; PCB mode is a major mode for editing files for the gEDA PCB program within
;; Emacs. To load it automatically for both footprint (.fp) and pcb (.pcb)
;; files, add the following incantation to your .emacs:
;;
;;   (let ((pair
;;          (cons (concat "\\." (regexp-opt '("pcb" "fp"))) 'pcb-mode)))
;;     (setf auto-mode-alist
;;           (cons pair (remove pair auto-mode-alist))))
;;
;; If you don't want to load this file every time Emacs starts, you should
;; ensure it is in your load path and then add the following form:
;;
;;   (autoload 'pcb-mode "pcb-mode" "Mode for editing PCB files" t)
;;
;; For more information on usage, see the docstring for `pcb-mode'.

(defun pcb-mode ()
  "Major mode for editing files for the gEDA PCB program.

The mode features syntax highlighting and automatic
indentation. To control the basic offset of the indentation,
customize the variable `pcb-mode-offset'.

There is support for `imenu', useful in layout files. The indexed
items are elements and they are listed by refdes. To use it,
either use \\[imenu] or use the \"Elements\" menu item.

There is symbol completion at point (use \\[complete-symbol]),
which completes the PCB keywords. For quicker insertion of
keywords with lots of parameters, there is also support for
\"templated insertion\" using the tempo library. To use this,
make sure abbrev mode is enabled (\\[abbrev-mode]) and then
insert one of the following keywords into your file, followed by
a space or new line:

  elt, eltarc, eltline, pad, pin

These correspond to Element, ElementArc, ElementLine, Pad and Pin
in the PCB file, respectively. To be prompted for the parameters
in turn, ensure that `tempo-interactive' is on. (The default is
off)

Another convenience is `pcb-mode-insert-pad-as-rectangle', which
is bound to \\[pcb-mode-insert-pad-as-rectangle]. This allows the
user to insert a pad by giving the corners of the rectangle it
should cover.

PCB mode supports the minor mode `eldoc-mode'. This is off by
default; to turn it on use (\\[eldoc-mode]). For
backwards-compatibility reasons, PCB allows several different
sets of arguments to each keyword, which makes guessing argument
lists rather problematic. We try to guess which one is right by
looking at the brackets used and the number of arguments, but
this is probably rather brittle.

As is standard for major modes, there is a `pcb-mode-hook', which
is a list of functions that get called just before `pcb-mode'
finishes setting things up. This is a good place to do things
like enabling `eldoc-mode' or `abbrev-mode'."
